# Sample .htaccess file for Apache
# Put it in the same folder as your manifest, not in the root,
# otherwise no files will cache. I suggest creating a separate
# folder i.e. /manifest/ where you put this file and the manifest.
#

# Serve the manifest with the right file mime type
AddType text/cache-manifest .appcache
AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest

# Ensure that it is never cached so we dont go insane
